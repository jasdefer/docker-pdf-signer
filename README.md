# docker-pdf-signer
A lightweight Dockerized CLI tool that adds an SVG signature to a PDF without local installations. Mount a folder, specify page, position, and scale, and the container embeds the signature as true vector graphics. Outputs a signed PDF with deterministic placement and full multi-page support.
